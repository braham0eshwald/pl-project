The code implements a Date class that represents a date (day, month, year) and provides methods to work with it. Here's what it does:

Date Validation :
Checks if a date is valid, considering the number of days in a month and leap years.
Throws an error if the date is invalid.
Updating the Date :
Allows updating the date to a new value if it passes the validation check.
Day of the Week :
Determines the day of the week for a given date (e.g., "Sunday" or "Monday").
Difference Between Dates :
Calculates the difference in days between the current date and another date.
Readable Date Format :
Displays the date in a human-readable format, such as "January 1, 2023".
Date Comparison :
Implements functionality to compare dates (e.g., for sorting).
String Representation :
Returns the date in the YYYY-MM-DD format for easy output.
